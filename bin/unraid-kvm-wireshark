# wireshark and tcpdump have different filter syntaxes
# wireshark can take a display filter in its usual format using the -Y flag
# these can be provided respectively
# e.g.: capture only non-ssh traffic display only icmp traffic in wireshark
# unraid-kvm-wireshark director "not port 22" "icmp"
#
# in this example we also leverage the ability to configure the titlebar!
# ssh web004 tcpdump -i tunl0 -U -s0 -w - 'not port 22' | wireshark -k -Y "icmp"  -i - -o "gui.window_title:Realserver/tunl0"

ssh ubuntu@$(unraid-kvm-getaddr $1) sudo tcpdump -i any -U -s0 -w - "$2" | wireshark -Y "$3" -k -i -
